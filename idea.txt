I will create a website for our capture the flag project for information and security, create a keypoints of what needs to be done and flow and functionality of the website, I will develop it in react vite. It should have a theme of detective or mystery in terms of palette and typography and logo, the landing page should have the logo in center and subtext and Enter. after that there would be a popup of short ad that like Are you Ready to Solve the mystery something like that and it is skippable button, after that there would be now the page for entering the special code, since it will be connected to the section like (tn35), name of the student also, after entering there should be stating if are u sure with the credential (Access Code -> Section -> Student name). Now after entering the user will now see a 15 tile card that is randomized that is flipabble once flip it will now make a popup there would be a modal for riddle or question there is a button in below Skip, Decode, Hint (x3). for every correct answered tiled question there corresponding points. There would be a duration once the student entered and see now the tiled question page at the top right. After the duration ended the game will now end for everyone, the score points will be tallied.


In Admin Page, admin can set access code, put questions, put answer, set if it is easy med or hard, there is a corresponding points each for difficulty can also be manually editable per question, as well as # of hints possible and the hints stated from the chosen # of hints. It's like quizziz that the admin should be the one to start the game and set timer for all students, access code is corresponding sections, so like generate access code then admin enter what section name, the admins can also see the leaderboards and list of points of the student per section filterable,
