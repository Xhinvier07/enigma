# Group Functionality Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### Database Schema Updates (`group-migration.sql`)
- Added `group_members` column (TEXT[]) to the `students` table to store array of member names
- Added `question_seed` column (INTEGER) for consistent question ordering based on access code
- Created helper functions:
  - `get_group_members`: Retrieves group members by access code
  - `add_group_member`: Adds a new member to an existing group
  - `get_active_students`: Updated to include group_members data
  - `stop_all_sessions_by_code`: New function to stop all sessions with a specific access code
- Added an index on the access_code column for faster lookups

### Authentication Updates
- Modified `AuthPage.jsx`:
  - Updated to support multiple members input (1-8 members)
  - Added UI for adding/removing members
  - Updated validation schema to handle member array
  - Modified confirmation screen to display all members
- Updated `authUtils.js`:
  - Changed `validateAccessCode` to check for existing groups
  - Replaced `registerStudent` with `registerGroup` to handle multiple members
  - Updated session storage to track access code and group ID

### Database Utilities Updates
- Modified `dbUtils.js`:
  - Added `checkExistingGroup` to see if a group with the access code exists
  - Added `registerGroup` to create a new group with multiple members
  - Added `addGroupMembers` to update an existing group with new members
  - Added seeded randomization functions to ensure consistent question ordering
  - Updated `fetchQuestions` to use seed for consistent ordering
  - Updated other functions to maintain backward compatibility

### Game Logic Updates
- Updated `gameUtils.js`:
  - Modified `fetchQuestions` to support seed-based randomization
  - Ensured consistent question ordering for all members of a group
- Updated `GameBoard.jsx`:
  - Modified to use groupId instead of studentId
  - Increased polling frequency for more responsive updates
  - Updated the UI to show access code
  - Made GameBoard retrieve and use question_seed for consistent ordering

### Timer Synchronization
- Updated `GameTimer.jsx`:
  - Added additional useEffect to properly handle endTime updates from polling
  - Ensures timer is synchronized across all group members

## How the Group System Works

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User enters an access code and group member names (1-8)
   - System checks if a group with that access code already exists
   - If yes, it adds the new members to the existing group
   - If no, it creates a new group with the provided members
   - The question_seed is derived from the access code to ensure consistent question ordering

2. **Session Sharing**:
   - All members using the same access code share:
     - Timer (countdown to end time)
     - Completed questions
     - Points earned
     - Question ordering

3. **Synchronization Mechanism**:
   - Regular polling (every 5 seconds) checks for updates to group data
   - When any member completes a question, it's marked as completed for all
   - When the game ends (by time or manually), it ends for all members

4. **Consistent User Experience**:
   - Group members see the same questions in the same order
   - Progress is immediately synchronized across all active sessions
   - End time is consistent for all group members
